# NOTE: TESTING DISABLED!
# The v4l2loopback kernel module cannot be installed as it depends
# on v4l2 (videodev) kernel support.
# videodev can either be built into the kernel directly or supported
# as loadable module.
# Azure (which is what GitHub Actions uses) only offers videodev
# in linux-modules-extra-azure starting from Ubuntu 20.10.
# See https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=groovy&arch=any&mode=exactfilename&searchon=contents&keywords=videodev.ko
# However, GitHub Actions only uses LTS releases of Ubuntu and they
# are currently at 20.04 LTS. The next LTS will be 22.04 LTS
# which will come out in 2022.
