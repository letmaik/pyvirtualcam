- Linux support via [v4l2loopback](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback) (#29).
- RGB frame support (in addition to RGBA).
- `Camera.device` property containing the name of the virtual camera device.
- New sample: send video frames to virtual camera (#9).

### Changed
- Windows support relies on [OBS Virtual Camera (built-in)](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/26.1.0) now. Support for [OBS-VirtualCam](https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam) has been removed (#25).
