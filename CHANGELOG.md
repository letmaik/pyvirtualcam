- If `print_fps=True` and `Camera.sleep_until_next_frame()` is used, the percentage of time spent in computation is printed in addition to fps.

### Changed
- macOS/Windows: raise error if OBS virtual camera is not installed.

### Fixed
- macOS: camera was not correctly cleaned up after use (#39).

- `Camera.device` property containing the name of the virtual camera device.
- New sample: send video frames to virtual camera (#9).

### Changed
- Windows support relies on [OBS Virtual Camera (built-in)](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/26.1.0) now. Support for [OBS-VirtualCam](https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam) has been removed (#25).

### Deprecated
- RGBA frame format. Use RGB instead.
- `delay` argument of `Camera` is deprecated and has no effect.
